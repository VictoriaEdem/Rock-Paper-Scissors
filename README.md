# Rock-Paper-Scissors

DESCRIPTION

I created a simple version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Each rounds winner is determined by these rules; Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper. 
In my version, one player is controlled by the computer(CPU) and the other player controlled by me - the user. The list of possible options includes "R" for "rock", "P" for "paper", "S" for "scissors". When the program is run, the user is asked to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S". If user input is invalid (not amongst possible options) an error is printed, and user is asked for their input again. 
Computer's choices are controlled by the `choice` function from the inbuilt Python `random` module. 
If there is a winner, winner is printed, and the program ends.
If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), the game is restarted from asking the user to pick an option.
